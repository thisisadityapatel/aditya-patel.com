This made it easier to collect, store, and analyze logs, providing valuable data for our deployment process. I also built Full Stack Dashboard applications using React.js and Typescript, with a Django back-end. These dashboards included mathematical calculations to offer DevOps DORA and SPACE insights and boosted enterprise leadtime rate by 32%.",
            "I managed various Python DAGs for scheduled data tasks, making data collection, storage, and analysis more streamlined by integrating with Elasticsearch through Apache Airflow. This led to an impressive 82% efficiency improvement. Additionally, I created a scalable Python API that utilized GitHub Secret Scanning. This automated the detection and resolution of hard-coded passwords in code across Enterprise GitHub, greatly enhancing security by addressing over 80,000 vulnerabilities at RBC.",
