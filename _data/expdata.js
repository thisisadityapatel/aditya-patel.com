I had the chance to work with advanced web development technologies, including working with large datasets, bulk editing, APIs, encryption, and intelligent prediction using analytics/machine learning.",

            "It was an excellent opportunity to learn and grow personally, getting a chance to gain exposure to capital markets and the financial world. The opportunity to collaborate with the other engineers on the team was a great way to learn more about their approaches and experiences.",
            "At the GBM Tech Showcase, I presented my projects to the COO and Executive of GBM, where I talked about the impact, utility and benefits of the tools I developed. If you want to learn more about my work at Scotiabank in a more technical detail, don't hesitate to get in touch with me."
